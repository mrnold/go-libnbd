# go-libnbd
Importable Golang bindings for libnbd, extracted from official libguestfs.org releases.

This repository includes all the auto-generated golang files from the official libguestfs.org releases of libnbd, so that the bindings can be imported with `go.mod` or `go get`. This is intended as a temporary measure to allow [CDI](https://github.com/kubevirt/containerized-data-importer) to make use of libnbd for warm migration.
